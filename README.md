# Financial Projects Repository
This is my Financial Projects Repository; a central hub where I publish my financial analysis, modelling, and research projects. Whether you're an investor, a financial analyst, or just someone with an interest in finance, I hope you find the resources here useful and insightful.

#### Projects:
1. 	Portfolio optimisation – analysing historical stock prices to find an optimal portfolio for a mean variance investor.
2.	Price prediction (incomplete) – uses machine learning to analyse historical indicators to predict the direction of movement for tomorrow’s price.
3.	Trading algorithum (incomplete) - accesses binance API to extract live candlestick data, conduct technical analysis, and then conduct necessary trades.

#### Viewing:
To view these projects, it depends on whether you want to edit or view it. If you just want to view the code and its output, then follow the link to the project and look at the preview. To download, edit, or rerun the outputs, you can clone the repository onto your local device.
